"""The road graph from OpenStreetMap, in a map's tiles: junction-to-junction
links, each with a class and a width in whole tiles.

The map's frame is the renderer's (its Projector, turned as the map is), so
what comes out lines up with the map as built.
Footways and paths are left for their own pass; tunnels are left out (the
ground is flat). A way's ends and every node it shares with another way are
graph nodes; a node where just two ways of one class meet end to end is
merged away, so a link runs junction to junction. Then generalised: a small
turning loop is a dead end, a dual carriageway one wide road, a lane hugging
a bigger road part of it.
